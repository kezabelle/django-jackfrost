^^^^^^

* Added a ``--dry-run`` argument to the ``collectstaticsite`` management command
  to preview changes using the standard Django server, without writing anything
  to the storage backend.
* Moved ``jackfrost.utils.build_page_for_obj`` and ``jackfrost.utils.eventlog_write`
  to ``receivers`` to better represent their use as signal listeners.
* Raise an error if a URL doesn't end with a slash or a file extension.

0.4.0
^^^^^^

* Added ``signals.write_page`` which is fired after the storage backend has
  written the content.
* Added ``utils.eventlog_write`` for using `pinax.eventlog`_ and the
  aforementioned ``write_page`` signal to track built items.
* Added a `ModelAdmin action`_ for building a selection of model instances
  into their static counterparts, from the admin changelist.
* Made the receiver ``utils.build_page_for_obj`` actually work.
* the ``models`` module will be compiled using Cython, if installed.
